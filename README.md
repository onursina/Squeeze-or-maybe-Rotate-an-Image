# Squeeze-or-maybe-Rotate-an-Image
Great pic squeezing and rotation algorithms written in Kotlin

My backwards solution for the path is great:
After Dijkstra's algorithm we know the exit point but we don't know the path...
So use my backwards solution (fun backwardsReSolvePath & fun findX & fun checkAt) for it doesn't require any memory or deep calculations....
